            <p class="mt-5 lg:text-lg text-white">This is a small website that uses AniList's API to
                get the total number of characters voiced by a voice actor, based on a user's list. In AniList's stats
                page for Staff, only main characters are
                counted towards statistics, which leads to some differences if every character were to be counted.
